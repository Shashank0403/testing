# Voice-Based-Email
The project aims to develop a voice based email system that would help blind people to access email in a hassle free manner. As E-mail is considered to be the most reliable way for sending or receiving information over the internet. But there are some visually challenged people(blind people) who find it challenging to use email.
This will not only help the blind people to communicate easily but it will also help people who are not well acquainted with technology and are unable to read or write. It can be 
used by the general population also because, in this modern world, where most precious and valuable thing is nothing but the "TIME", we only uses "VOICE" as the command in project that means the time we use to waste on typing on keyboard will be eliminated and moreover it will not only save time for blind people but also for all of us. So definitely it will have a massive impact and advantage over today's techniques.
